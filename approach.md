## Approach

* Looking at the data-set it looks like be time series dataset, approach should be used time series python libraries

* Looking at the dataset, can be seen that the data has both Trend + Seasonality

* Libraries to use - Can either use the libraries statmodels (which is used in the solution) or facebook's Prophet (could have also been used)

## Possible extension

* Could have used the Holidays from Indian Calender to get more refinement on the solution

* Could have thought of using the "number" (i.e. customer ID's), if the number of customers weren't too many.
